        <h1>Congratulations Enhasa!</h1>
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h2>Me and Enhasa has known eachother for a while now, but how did we meet eachother for the first time?</h2>
            <div class="item-wrapper">
                
                <p> Me and Enhasa worked together on a small techservice company called Telia. 
                    <br>He had worked there for quite a while before i started.
                    <br><br>After a 5 week learning course, i finally got placed in a team.
                    <br>I noticed that the workdesk next to me was empty but i saw a name on a papersheet. "Enhasa".
                    <br>I remember thinking to myself that i hope he's not a "bad guy".
                    <br><br>The next day arrives and i get to work a bit early, after a while i see a guy that i can't recognise from the day before. Marching past me, sits down on the chair next to me, not saying a word.. Not even acknowledging my existens.
                    <br><br>I sigh for myself thinking "Ohwell, i guess he's not intrested in getting to know me, He might even dislike the fact that im here."
                    <br><br>A couple of hours goes by, when i hear a voice saying "Yo Enhasa! Check out my new Meme!"
                    <br> Another collegue "Joel" walked next to Enhasa, explaining the meme like it was something revelutionary.
                    <br> I sharpen my ears hoping to find something we have in common. Maybe well get along?
                    <br><br> After Joel walked back to his desk, i akwardly say "Soo, did i hear memes?, what type of memes are we talking about?"
                    <br>He looks at me with a mildly confused look, but answers with curiosity:"Oh, its just some gaming memes, nothing special."
                    <br><br>There i had it! Gaming, (Ive Been a gamer my whole life, surely i would find something common with this guy.) "So, what types of games are we talking?"
                </p>
                <h2>After that, it clicked.</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>We started to talk outside work, play games, he introduced me to new people, i introduced them to new games.
                    <br>We started to talk every day from when we got to work in the morning, til bedtime.
                    <br>Eating lunch together to even break workrules to get our breaks together.
                    <br>I knew that this would be a friendship of a lifetime!
                </p>
                <h2>Then.. I got fired</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>Well, not rlly fired. My contract was bound for 6 months, after that they would either ask you to stay 6 more months.. or leave..
                    <br>The last two months at Telia was hard. I've had grown acustomed. I liked the days we had, even if we wasnt as productive as we shoulve been.
                    <br>I think the most of the team felt that something was goin to change. 
                    <br><br>But we stayed in touch, gaming as usual on the evenings. Talking about how amazing it would've been for us to be coworkers again.
                    <br>What a dream.
